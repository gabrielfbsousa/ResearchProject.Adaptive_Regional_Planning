## Project Detailing
### Details
Complex systems are expected to be scalable, available, and amenable to execute in heterogeneous environments. Addressing such requirements continuously is a challenging task and endowing software systems with self-adaptive capabilities has been advocated as a promising approach to tackle this issue. Self-Adaptive Systems can adapt themselves in run-time, as a response to keep delivering quality services even in the presence of environment disturbances. However, in highly dynamic environments, the adoption of decentralized self-adaptation approaches usually results in slow adaptations, whereas centralized ones create potential bottlenecks and limit scalability. The adaptive regional planner mechanism we propose herein allows for large self-adaptive systems to perform well in highly dynamic and unpredictable environments. We have evaluated the proposal by using simulation and results show that the use of adaptive regional planner improves control performance.
